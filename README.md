# 👋 Hi, I'm Xavier

🚀 I work as a **Solutions Architect at Giant Swarm** where I build managed Kubernetes platforms and help customers figure out how to best make use of them.

🗺 After being a VMware engineer for several years I decided to transition to the Cloud Native world where I specialise on Kubernetes infrastructure and architecture. My work involves a healthy mix of pre-sales, customer success, operations, site reliability engineering at times and some platform engineering wherever I can help.

🔭 *I am a tinkerer who likes (somehow ends up) learning about all sorts of things. I took an interest in smart home tech which for me is the perfect mix of DIY and tech (overengineering it really).*
